# 📰 Fake News Detection — BERT-based Classification with Streamlit

👉 **[Live Demo / Project Link](https://fakenewsdetection-9ix5r3mbvwd9vakvdh6j3f.streamlit.app/)**  

---

This project focuses on building a robust **fake news detection system** using the **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** model. We initially explored traditional machine learning approaches for fake news classification, but later moved to BERT to incorporate **contextual understanding** of language — significantly improving performance.

## 🧠 Why BERT?

Traditional ML methods often rely on frequency-based features (e.g., TF-IDF), which lack context and struggle with paraphrasing or subtle differences in tone. BERT, on the other hand, understands word meaning based on surrounding context, making it ideal for fake news detection.

We fine-tuned the **`bert-base-uncased`** model using Hugging Face Transformers, achieving:

> ✅ **F1 Score: 99.98% on validation data**

This highlights BERT's ability to generalize even on challenging real-world text classification tasks.

## 🚀 Streamlit Interface

To make the model accessible, we built a **Streamlit web application** that allows users to paste any news article and instantly check if it’s real or fake.

### Features:
- Paste full article or headline
- Click **Predict**
- View result: ✅ Real or ❌ Fake
